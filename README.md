# FIFA 20 Analysis: Player Clustering & Wage Prediction

**Duration:** [29th Oct 2025 – 7th Nov 2025]

**Project Type:** Data Analysis & Machine Learning

# Overview
- A comprehensive analysis of the FIFA 20 players dataset to explore player skills, market value, and development trends.
- This project involves clustering players based on performance attributes and building regression models to predict player wages, providing data-driven insights for team management and recruitment strategies.

# Key Features
- Player Clustering: Used K-Means clustering to categorize players into distinct archetypes based on skill attributes (e.g., Offensive vs. Defensive specialists).
- Wage Prediction: Developed and compared multiple regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) to accurately predict player wages.
- Strategic Insights: Analyzed the "peak age" of players and determined which offensive roles (Strikers vs. Wingers) command the highest salaries.
- Global Trends: Ranked the top 10 countries producing professional-level talent.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (K-Means, Regression Models)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- XGBoost
